Something always pops up, needs your urgent attention, or is waiting to be scheduled. To manage these tasks effectively, you need to prioritize them. Often, prioritization is based on importance, urgency (deadlines), or a combination of both.
By prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency, you can manage your responsibilities better.
Realization 2: Use A Single Tracking System As an adult, you receive action items from various sources—emails, calendars, Jira, documents, spreadsheets, phone calls, and more.</description></item><item><title>How I Got Interested in Building Scalable Systems for my life</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/day_4_how_i_got_interested_in_building_scalable_systems_for_my_life/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/day_4_how_i_got_interested_in_building_scalable_systems_for_my_life/</guid><description>I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call myself an expert in productivity or system design.
However, I have spent 5,000 hours reading and learning about productivity and system design. And I have probably spent 3,000 hours practicing and integrating these concepts into my own life.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how I first became interested in building a scalable system for my own life: It was the summer of 2021. I was falling behind on work, duties related to a rental property, personal projects, and meeting with friends and family.</description></item><item><title>The Best Way To Get Started Learning About Android Development</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/day_3_the_best_way_to_get_started_learning_about_android_development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/day_3_the_best_way_to_get_started_learning_about_android_development/</guid><description>I love learning about Android Development.

Anyone can write code that compiles and runs thanks to a wide range of IDEs (integrated development environments). Here are three important skills that transform you into a software engineer:
Skill #1: Robustness Writing code that works in ideal conditions is one thing, but ensuring that it operates under various edge cases, unexpected inputs, and adverse conditions is another.</description></item><item><title>Day 1: Why I'm Starting To Write Online</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/day_1_why_i_m_starting_to_write_online_ship30for30/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/day_1_why_i_m_starting_to_write_online_ship30for30/</guid><description>I recently signed up for Dickie Bush &amp;amp; Nicolas Cole&amp;rsquo;s cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30.

With Bootstrap theme as my ideal choice, I decided to nosedive into migrating over until I was faced with my first blocker&amp;hellip; upgrading Hugo to its latest version.
My current Hugo version: 0.61.0
The new theme’s minimum required version: 0.75.0
What could be so interesting about upgrading Hugo that I decided to write a blog post about it?</description></item><item><title>How to create your custom Link in Bio landing page in Hugo under 10 mins</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how_to_build_custom_link_in_bio_landing_social_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how_to_build_custom_link_in_bio_landing_social_page/</guid><description>Link in Bio landing pages became very popular since Instagram limited only single URL per profile info.

The greater the number of people who view your resume, the greater the chance of being offered an interview - it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that.</description></item><item><title>When and how to use RxJava Disposable</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/when_how_use_rxjava_disposable_serialdisposable_compositedisposable/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/when_how_use_rxjava_disposable_serialdisposable_compositedisposable/</guid><description>Featured in Android Weekly Issue #472. Table Of Contents: Disposable CompositeDisposable SerialDisposable Conclusion Disposable RxJava 2 introduced the concept of Disposables .
Disposables are streams/links/connections between Observer and Observable. They&amp;rsquo;re meant to give power to the Observers to control Observables. In most cases, the Observer is a UI element, ie; Fragment, Activity, or a corresponding viewmodel of those elements. While Observable represents a data flow where data can be passed from one source to another and get modified along the way if needed.</description></item><item><title>How to display notifications in 2020</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how-to-display-notification-in-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how-to-display-notification-in-2020/</guid><description>These days, most startup apps heavily rely on third-party libraries to send push notifications to a user, thus causing developers to usually not pay too much attention to Android notification changes.
For example, I was working on my side-project which sends a notification once the download is completed (was checking how DownloadManager works).
Back in 2016, you&amp;rsquo;d need to initialize NotificationManager and pending intent if notification contains custom action:

Kotlin is well-known for null-safety and extension functions features among android developers. Extension functions provide the ability to make new functionality of an extending class without making changes to it. In addition, the new functionality can be declared outside of the extending class. They&amp;rsquo;re also very beneficial when you want to tweak an api that can&amp;rsquo;t be modified.</description></item></channel></rss>
