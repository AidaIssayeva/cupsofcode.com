Table Of Contents: Disposable CompositeDisposable SerialDisposable Conclusion Disposable RxJava 2 introduced the concept of Disposables .
Disposables are streams/links/connections between Observer and Observable. They&amp;rsquo;re meant to give power to the Observers to control Observables.

Kotlin is well-known for null-safety and extension functions features among android developers. Extension functions provide the ability to make new functionality of an extending class without making changes to it. In addition, the new functionality can be declared outside of the extending class.
