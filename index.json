[{"categories":["Personal"],"content":" Table Of Contents:   Prerequisites New Formula Setup  1. Track 2. Plan 3. Reflect   Results Final Thoughts    Prerequisites A year into COVID lockdown I started noticing how my attention span has gone down dramatically. Often I‚Äôd forget why I even stepped into a room or simply what was the next thing I wanted to do. Having these symptoms with a full-time job, side-projects I wanted some traction on, home needs, and rental property requests was not easy. I‚Äôd frequently get overwhelmed and anxious which would lead to a trickle down effect on all areas of my life.\nFirst, I decided to tackle down the main issue - being overwhelmed. To be honest, this is the natural side effect for people who pile everything up until the last minute. My whole life as I remember myself I‚Äôd always do and finish everything on the last day of the deadline. This process (or lack of thereof) is what worked well and got me straight A‚Äôs all throughout my school life, so why stop?\nWelp - as it turns out (not surprisingly), waiting till the last minute to clear out all your to-do‚Äôs doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale well once more areas of your life start appearing that require attention.\nA bad habit of putting things off til the last minute had a waterfall effect on all other habits in my life. In Q4 of 2021, I finished reading a book called Atomic Habits which suggested doing an inventory of my habits, and so I did. Main common theme among all of my habits was not being consistent. To give an example: there will be weeks where I didn‚Äôt workout - followed by an entire month where I religiously did hardcore workouts everyday, so at the end it all squares out.\nAnd because time is a fixed variable, a little bit of more proper planning and coordination was required from me. So I asked Twitter in 2021:\nHey, #AndroidDev üëã\nüìå Can you please recommend me a good productivity tool, where one can create and manage personal, professional, side-project tasks toward goals all in one, see them in calendar view/have the widget for it, track goal progress, and retrospect?\n\u0026mdash; Aida Issayeva üåª (@Aida_Isay) November 11, 2021  Subsequently I started googling and researching the various approaches people take to combat this very common issue most adults face. I learned about different methodologies when it came to task management: from time blocking, to task batching, to energy management.\nThere were so many different ways I wanted to try, but was there a tool that could handle all the competing priorities in one‚Äôs life while being able to store and display historic data of all completed/not completed tasks? Google Search recommended Notion .\nFor the second issue - anxiety - a lot of people suggested daily journaling, where you pour everything you have on your mind onto a notepad. I‚Äôve always been an adamant nay-sayer of it since my early ages. But decided to give it a quick run and see how it goes.\nNew Formula Every year, I tend to assign an overarching theme to be sort of a North Star for all goals of that year. For 2022, I refined my approach and decided not just set a theme or word, but dig deeper into my identity and choose a theme from there.\nHowever, ‚Äômy Identity‚Äô was such a vague word that it didn‚Äôt ring any bells. I tried searching hard for it, but it led me nowhere. So instead of trying to find ‚Äòwho I was‚Äô, I decided to shift my focus onto ‚Äòwho I wanted to become‚Äô [If I remember correctly, this is one of the exercises from Atomic Habits book]. This is what finally helped me identify some of the habits I wanted to elevate on my daily routine.\nMy ‚Äòwho I wanted to become‚Äô identity is all around wellbeing: physical, emotional, financial, spiritual. At the core of it all, emotional wellbeing is paramount, and with my constant state of overwhelmed and anxious, it was what I struggled with the most. Thankfully, after some serious internal debugging, I came up with a formula to achieve that identity:\n1Proper task management + consistent habits = emotional wellbeing With this in mind, I dove into 2022.\nSetup When it came to setup, my cycle was Track ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Reflect:\nBy tracking your progress you can understand where you currently stand, how far you‚Äôve come, and how much you‚Äôve accomplished. Planning out how you‚Äôre going to reach the goals helps you to keep focused and on track. Reflecting on your progress allows you to see what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt, and make adjustments as needed. This cycle can help you stay motivated and on track toward achieving goals.\n1. Track a) There is a famous phrase by Peter Drucker ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt improve what you don‚Äôt measure‚Äù. I‚Äôm a firm believer of the phrase.\nBut how do you measure being overwhelmed and anxious? Often times when we think of measures - we get stuck on well-known measuring units, and easily dismiss other ways of measure. Granted, it‚Äôs near impossible to find uniformed ways to measure emotions and decision-making skills across a population, because there are too many variables in play.\nHowever, when we take into account only YOU and YOUR emotions and feelings, measuring them becomes a matter of personal choice and later a habit. For example, I chose to track emotions every day to see a historic overview of how I felt throughout the week, month and year. b) For proper task management, I chose to track the amount of time allocated to finish it. I used the famous Pomodoro technique , where each task is defined by size of tomatoes(üçÖ).\n1 tomato is 30mins (25mins deep work + 5 mins break), 2 tomatoes is 1 hour of work, and so on. Maximum number of tomatoes for each task is 4 tomatoes = 2 hours of work. This restriction helped me to break down tasks.\n2. Plan After identifying tracking units, the next step step is planning. It all starts with taking the time to think ahead and set clear goals, identify steps needed to reach those goals, and finally, make sure you have resources and support to make them happen.\nWhen it comes to planning, there are different levels you can do it on:\n On a weekly basis, you can plan out your to-do list and schedule for the coming week. Monthly planning can involve setting goals for the month, and reviewing progress on yearly goals. Quarterly planning is all about checking in on the bigger picture and making sure you are on track for the year. And annual planning is where you set big picture goals for the next 12 months.  3. Reflect But before planning, one should retrospect first on the previous cycle.\nMy preferred level of planning \u0026amp; reflecting is a weekly level. It gives me the ability to frequently check-in on habits \u0026amp; progress, go into a greater details about what worked \u0026amp; didn‚Äôt work, and enough flexibility to adjust goals \u0026amp; priorities.\n Reflecting on a weekly basis involves taking some time to review what you have accomplished during the week, what went well, and what didn\u0026rsquo;t go as planned. This reflection can help you gain a better understanding of your productivity, your habits, and your progress towards your goals.\n By taking the time to reflect on your week, you can identify patterns and trends in your behavior that may be hindering your productivity or progress. You can also identify areas where you may need to adjust your goals or your approach to tasks.\nReflection can also help you celebrate your successes and acknowledge your accomplishments. This can help boost your motivation and confidence as you move forward.\nWhen it comes to future planning, reflection is essential. By reviewing what worked and what didn\u0026rsquo;t in the previous week, you can make more informed decisions about how to allocate your time and resources in the upcoming week. You can also adjust your goals and priorities based on your reflections to ensure that you are focusing on what matters most to you.\nOverall, reflecting on a weekly basis can help you stay on track, improve your productivity, and make more intentional decisions about how you spend your time. It can also help you develop a growth mindset, where you view challenges and setbacks as opportunities for learning and improvement.\nResults  Proper task management is still a work in progress for me.  In order to effectively manage tasks, it\u0026rsquo;s important to both plan and execute properly. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve struggled with both aspects of task management, and this has taught me a lot about myself in Q1 of 2022. Here are some of the key things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned:\na) I have a tendency to underestimate the amount of time required to complete tasks, which often leads me to stack my days with too many tasks during my weekly planning.\nb) Due to this, some tasks end up rolling over to the next day, which can make me feel overwhelmed and stressed, especially if that day is already full of tasks.\nc) When I see too many tasks on my to-do list, it can cause me to procrastinate and do nothing. Essentially, procrastination has become my coping mechanism for when I feel like I have too much on my plate.\nSince the main issue was overestimating how much I can realistically complete in a day, I started tracking my planned vs completed tasks on a weekly basis. This allowed me to identify where I needed to adjust my planning and be more realistic about what I could accomplish.\nThe results of my tracking have shown that my average completion rate for 2022 was only 55%, meaning I completed only half of what I had planned. The top 10 feelings I experienced in 2022 (as shown in the chart) speak for themselves: Moving forward into 2023, I\u0026rsquo;m being more intentional about what I plan and how I fill up my week. I hope this will help me to better plan and execute my tasks.\nDaily Journaling was a pleasant surprise for me!  I noticed that simply writing out my emotions made me feel lighter and more at ease. After two months of consistent journaling, I also noticed a positive shift in my mood and perspective towards my daily challenges.\nI was able to reduce my tendency to overreact and overthink, and most importantly, it helped me manage my anxiety. This was a significant accomplishment for me last year! As I look to the future and the kind of person I want to become, daily journaling is the one habit that I know I want to continue doing every day.\nConsistent Habits became possible because of visual reminders.  I am grateful that I chose Notion to organize my digital workspace, which gave me the flexibility to prioritize what\u0026rsquo;s important to me, including my habits. Initially, I trained myself to open Notion first thing in the morning instead of opening social media, so I could see how busy my day was and what was in store for me.\nIt took several iterations to find a good setup that helped me feel productive and avoid procrastination or feeling overwhelmed. But by mid-year, after many adjustments, I found a setup that worked for me: As you can see, the left side of the setup has a list of habits for each specific day, making them hard to miss or skip.\nFinal Thoughts In conclusion, the COVID lockdown had a negative impact on my attention span and emotional wellbeing, leading to feelings of overwhelmedness and anxiety. To address these issues, I turned to task management tools and daily journaling, and focused on forming consistent habits based on the desired identity of prioritizing emotional wellbeing.\nDespite struggling with task management in 2022, I found that daily journaling had a positive impact on my mood and reduced anxiety.\nIn 2023, I am being more intentional about task planning and continue to prioritize daily journaling and consistent habits to support emotional wellbeing.\n","date":"Mar 29, 2023","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/tracking_my_way_to_joy_with_notion/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"Tracking My Way to Joy: A Year-Long Experiment of Self-Care and Personal Growth"},{"categories":["Personal"],"content":" Table Of Contents:   Personal Highlights Professional Highlights Challenges The Year in Numbers  Content Personal Growth Finances   Time wasters In the World Best of the Year Looking Ahead    Every year I like to take some time to reflect on the past 12 months. I think about all of my favorite moments and experiences from the year and consider what lessons I‚Äôve learned along the way.\nI conduct my annual reflection on December 31st of each year. However for 2022, while I was able to compete my yearly review, I wasn‚Äôt able to timely publish it. Now that I\u0026#39;ve had some time to consolidate my thoughts, here are my highlights of the year:   I chose \u0026ldquo;Visibility\u0026rdquo; to be my Word of The Year in 2022. And indeed the year was filled with events and opportunities that increased my visibility both online and offline. I became a Women Techmakers Ambassador and a Google Developer Expert in Android, and I prepared two technical talks on Jetpack Compose and spoke at 7 conferences. I also decided to focus more on creating content: wrote 4 articles, tweeted tips and tricks about Android development, and experimented with educational videos on Tiktok and Instagram. Overall, I really embraced the word of the year and made an effort to be more visible and present in the tech community.\nI was fortunate enough to have the support of independent conference organizers, who provided financial assistance for my talks, as well as the support of Google, who made it possible for me to attend Google Conferences. At the conferences, I had the opportunity to meet both old and new friends, and the connections I made have been invaluable. I was able to learn from industry experts, and network with other professionals. I‚Äôm extremely grateful for all conference organizers, who made it possible for me to speak and attend the conferences this year.\nPersonal Highlights  Establishing a weekly review process. This simple habit ended up being a huge accelerator for everything I accomplished in 2022. Reflecting on the past week and planning for the next one every Sunday has become a usual routine for me. It helps me become more proactive and less reactive in my day-to-day life.   Having a routine with pre-planned list of tasks for the day. This is a side effect of the first highlight, but it\u0026rsquo;s still worth mentioning separately. Having a daily routine that includes both: habits I want to embrace and encourage, and tasks + events that are planned for the day, sets an important mood to start your next 24 hours. This combination helps me to be more organized and productive.   Learning a lot about personal organization systems. I spent a lot of my free time this year learning about different personal organization systems for task management and goal setting, such as time blocking, task batching, energy-level mapping, PARA , GTD , the 12-week year , The Eisenhower Matrix, and identity-defined tasks and habits. I was really interested in finding the best system for me to stay organized and achieve my goals. Ultimately, I ended up mixing and matching different methodologies in practice. Taking Content seriously. Thanks to my established weekly review process, I was able to allocate time for writing and producing content. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t always easy, as it took longer than I anticipated, but the results were amazing. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I was able to make time for this important activity, and I\u0026rsquo;m proud of the content I created. Visiting Chicago. It is such a beautiful city! I had a 6-hour layover there back in 2017 and only had a chance to visit the Cloud Gate area. This time, I spent 4 days there and didn\u0026rsquo;t even open my laptop once because the city was so captivating. I made the most number of steps since the COVID pandemic began while I was in Chicago, it was that engaging!   Embracing landlord journey. In my 2021 review, I mentioned that being a landlord was not a truly passive job and at times it felt like a second full-time job. Dealing with tenants in 2021 was so difficult that my husband and I decided to move out of our house (which is a multifamily and we were living in one unit) and consider selling it. However, after 7 months of taking a mental break and coming to terms with the fact that it was just another job, we ultimately decided not to sell and instead fully accepted this journey as landlords. Buying home. This new house we are living in is also a multifamily, but our unit has its own private backyard, front yard, and a large office room. It\u0026rsquo;s also only a 10-minute walk from the Path station, which is a huge plus. We hope to live here for the next 5-7 years! Receiving Green Card. This 9-year-old immigration process has been quite a wild ride for me, especially in 2022. It‚Äôs been very exhausting, but i‚Äôm extremely happy that I won‚Äôt have to deal with USCIS again for the next 10 years. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge weight off my shoulders. 8 years + 10 months + 25 days\nlater I‚Äôm finally holding a green card üò≠üôèüôå\nThis feels surreal! I can finally visit my parents and sisters and hug them for the first time after so many years üò≠ pic.twitter.com/M0lDq90KrI\n\u0026mdash; Aida Issayeva üåª (@Aida_Isay) December 28, 2022   Trying new activities. I finally got to try rock climbing this year and it was a great experience. I have to admit, I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize my upper body was that weak, but it\u0026rsquo;s clear that I have a lot of room for improvement. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to continuing to try rock climbing in the coming year. One of my team\u0026rsquo;s offsites at Twitter included a rope challenge where we had to climb trees and poles of different levels of intensity, which was really cool. The last new activity I tried for my wellbeing was acupuncture, which I did 2-month long course. It helped a lot with my eczema. Re-visiting good old activities. I used to meal prep regularly when we were still going into the office, but during the COVID pandemic I stopped doing it. In 2022, I decided to slowly get back into meal prepping, especially if I know I have a busy week ahead. I try to spend time meal prepping on Sundays to set myself up for success. Another activity that I used to enjoy in the past is dancing, so I decided to take some dancing classes to amuse myself and get some exercise.  Professional Highlights  Starting a new job in January. The culture, vibe, and open-mindedness of my colleagues really resonated with me. Despite the Elon Musk drama, I was able to learn a lot and grow as an Android developer and as a person. It was the first time in a long time that I felt fulfilled and happy in all aspects of my job. Sadly, it was short! Ending that job in November. I thought a lot about what pill to take. Ultimately decided not to join 2.0 version. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go into too much detail about it due to my current non-working agreement, but perhaps I will write about my perspective on the matter at a later time. Becoming Android Google Developer Expert. Being a GDE is a recognition of giving back to Android community. I‚Äôm so happy and proud for becoming one. This also pushed me out of my comfort zone, and helped me write more technical articles and learned more about some Android APIs. Becoming Women TechMakers‚Äô Ambassador. Having this opportunity to serve as a role model and advocate for women in tech industry is a truly meaningful honor and something that is close to my heart. Giving talks at conferences. It was so exciting to speak at TechBash, Droidcon SF, Droidcon NYC, Chicago Roboto, Mobile Summit, Connect Recharge, etc. Not only did it further push me out of my comfort zone, but the preparation process also helped me to learn a lot about Jetpack Compose. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my knowledge and insights with others. Meeting fellow AndroidDevs IRL at the above conferences and Google IO \u0026amp; AndroidDevSummit \u0026amp; North America Connect. I was fortunate to attend many in-person events this year, and it was so much fun to connect with others who are passionate about the same work that I do.  Challenges Although the year was full of positive highlights, it had a fair share of challenges in all areas of my life. Here is the snippet list of some:\n Getting sick with COVID in and out Visiting Emergency Room Juggling multiple incoming requests at the same time at work Dealing with pipe issues in the rental: gas issue, frozen and bursted pipes Procrastinating (I did an analysis on it, will share soon) Switching between excitement and exhaustion was physically tiring. There is a thin line between the two states, and I found myself frequently jumping back and forth between them. It took a toll on my energy levels.  The Year in Numbers Content  1 newsletter sent 2 technical talks prepared 4 articles written 7 conferences presented on 47 Tiktok videos posted 175 tweets posted    Month # of tweets     January 17   February 25   March 18   April 19   May 14   June 15   July 18   August 13   September 16   October 12   November 6   December 2      At the beginning of the year, my key metric was to increase my followers on social media platforms. However, in the second quarter, I decided to shift my focus to producing content instead, since it was something within my control. I figured that follower growth would be a nice side effect of creating good content.\nPersonal Growth  Top 10 logged feelings   Top effective* days of the year  Looks like there was no single day this year where I felt like I accomplished everything I wanted to (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê). However, there were 23 days where I felt like I almost accomplished everything on my to-do list.\n*Effectiveness metric is about whether or not I feel like I was able to accomplish what I set out to do during the day.\n Properly planned week score  In late 2021, I discovered that I tend to underestimate the number of tasks I can complete in a day. As a result, I decided to track how well I plan my weeks. In 2022, my score was 54.5%!\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that I was off by that much. Sometimes it was because of an \u0026ldquo;emergency\u0026rdquo; that arose during the week, other times it was because I took on something unplanned, or because I procrastinated. However, most of the time it was due to my underestimation. I plan to write a separate article about this in the coming week.\n Workouts  I completed 187 workouts, not including above mentioned activities in Personal Highlights section .\nFinances I\u0026rsquo;ve been manually tracking all of my expenses for as long as I can remember. By manually, I mean physically inputting them into a spreadsheet rather than using personal finance management apps. The main reason I do this is because it gives me a better understanding of where my money is going and how to budget it. All of my expenses are divided into household, rental, personal, and business categories.\nInflation had a big impact on my numbers this year. Here\u0026rsquo;s a snippet from the household category(2 adults):\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy to see that we spent less on alcohol purchases this year!\nTime wasters I mentioned earlier about my habits of tracking my feelings, journaling every day, doing weekly reviews and planning. This meticulous tracking helped me to see the biggest time-wasters of the year, which often triggered negative emotions. At times, it felt like a test of strength from the universe. To my surprise, the top two time-wasters were organizations: USCIS (the immigration department) and PSEG (New Jersey‚Äôs Electric \u0026amp; Gas company). These two entities took up a significant amount of my time and mental energy. Last year, I spent 38.5 hours on the phone with PSEG and 26 hours filling out requests and emails to USCIS.\nIn the World There was a lot happening in my life behind the scenes, especially with my feelings and emotions. But there was also a lot happening around the world, especially in the parts where I grew up and where my family still lives. There were a lot of negative emotions boiled inside of me, that I didn‚Äôt share or post. #BloodyJanuary in Kazakhstan, then War in Ukraine left me scared, angry, disappointed, and disoriented. Possibly later in the year I‚Äôll write more about it.\nBest of the Year Miscellaneous things worth mentioning.\n Productivity tool - Notion - After two years of use, it remains the most outstanding tool I have ever come across. Fitness tool - FitON - My one and only fitness app that gives a daily doze of exercises! Even after five years, I cannot and will not stop recommending it to my friends and family. TV-show - Ozark - My absolute favorite best ending to a tv-series in the history of tv-shows. Its season finale was a great tribute to the series as a whole! Movie: none - Not a single movie from this year stood out as noteworthy.  Looking Ahead As I head into 2023, there are some things I want to do more of and some things I want to do less of. In order to make these changes, I have a system in place that helps me develop desired habits and discourage unwanted ones. Learning about different organization systems has helped me to understand the bigger picture of my life and how to set goals accordingly. Instead of focusing on annual goals, I\u0026rsquo;m shifting my focus to the roles that I want to embody in my life. These roles are built through the development of consistent habits. Here are some key habits that I want to focus on in 2023:\n I\u0026rsquo;ve had a bad habit of binge-watching for a long time, but it really got out of control last year. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about binge-watching for 10-12 hours at a time, not just a few episodes. It\u0026rsquo;s insane and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a big waste of time. I think it\u0026rsquo;s related to my OCD - I like to complete things as soon as possible and don\u0026rsquo;t like to drag things out. So this year, I want to binge-watch less. Unfortunately, the first week of the year didn\u0026rsquo;t start off well in this regard. I want to write more this year, especially long-form essays and blog posts. My focus will be on organizing my thoughts and ideas into a clear, cohesive train of thought rather than just a jumbled mess. I want to consistently meal prep this year. In 2022, the main question in my household was \u0026ldquo;What should we eat?\u0026rdquo;, and this question ended up taking up a lot of time, especially during lunch. But when we meal prep, we can just grab something from the fridge and don\u0026rsquo;t have to spend any time deciding what to eat. This also helps to avoid getting stuck in a rabbit hole of Yelp reviews and takeout options.  I have a lot of habits that I plan to continue and new ones that I want to pick up in 2023. I\u0026rsquo;ll share them in my 2023 review ;)\nI also want to spend some quality time with my family. I‚Äôm excited and terrified to see them in-person for the first time in 9 years!\nI‚Äôm truly grateful for all of the opportunities and challenges that 2022 brought me. It‚Äôs been a transformational year!\nI\u0026rsquo;m also excited for what 2023 has in store! I\u0026rsquo;m sure it will be amazing ‚ú®\n","date":"Jan 10, 2023","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/2022_review/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"2022 Year in Review"},{"categories":["Android Development"],"content":" Table Of Contents:   What is recomposition Why do you need to be concerned about recomposition? Tools to detect recomposition Final Thoughts    This post is extracted from my talk ‚ÄúWhat does recomposition mean to your app‚Äù .\nWhat is recomposition Recomposition is the action of forming something again or differently. When the term is used in Jetpack Compose, it means the action of executing the function again.\nJetpack Compose is a declarative UI toolkit in Android. The traditional XML-based style was imperative. The declarative style of building UI is focused on what to do, rather than how to do. It focuses on evaluating results based on input, rather than defining variables and changing their values.\nBecause Compose evaluates results based on the input of a function, a new input would trigger the recomposition that re-executes the function again.\nWhy do you need to be concerned about recomposition? When building a feature in Jetpack Compose, you might notice a drop in your UI performance: some sort of jitteriness, lag, unexpected behavior, etc.\nThis happens because of improper implementation of composable functions. On one hand, it‚Äôs forcing your UI to be recomposed excessively and do more work than necessary, thus directly affecting the performance of your app. On the other hand, it doesn‚Äôt update your UI when you expect it to recompose, thus leading to unexpected behavior and bugs in your app.\nWhen Compose updates a frame, it goes through three phases: Composition, Layout and Drawing. During these phases, Compose runs composable functions, builds the UI tree, determines size and placement of each element in the tree, and then renders each UI element.\nIt also has a built-in algorithm, smart recomposition, that can intelligently skip some of these tasks if they aren‚Äôt needed. However, improper implementation of composable functions makes it harder for Compose to know which tasks to skip, thus the recomposition can trigger these tasks all over again. It is potentially expensive in terms of time, computing power, and battery usage of a device.\nIn both cases, having a good set of tools, that will help you find issues, understand recomposition better, and learn the best practices of implementing composable functions, is beneficial for you to move through the learning curve of Jetpack Compose framework.\nTools to detect recomposition I‚Äôve compiled a list of tools that will help you to detect and debug recomposition in your app.\n Compose compiler metrics   Compiler metrics are reports about compose-specific concepts generated by Compose Compiler to understand what is happening with the code on fined-grain level.\n   Pros Cons     1.

If your goal of logging is not to track recomposition, then use DisposableEffect or LaunchEffect.\nLet‚Äôs overview some of the ways of placing log statements.\n Adding directly in function  1@Composable 2fun Example() { 3 println(\u0026#34;Example fun\u0026#34;) 4 Column { 5 } 6}  Putting behind SideEffect  1@Composable 2fun Example() { 3 SideEffect { 4 println(\u0026#34;Example fun\u0026#34;) 5 } 6 Column { 7 } 8}  Making a separate modifier , that counts number of recompositions.  1@Composable 2fun Example() { 3 Column( 4 modifier = Modifier.recompositionCounter(\u0026#34;column in Example\u0026#34;) 5 ) { 6 } 7}    Strategy Pros Cons     1. Adding directly in function easy to add logging happens even if recomposition failed or canceled ‚Üí in this case it‚Äôs better to leverage SideEffect   2.

Hyphenation in software engineering refers to the process of splitting a word and inserting hyphens in between the syllables of said word, that would otherwise extend beyond a UI element‚Äôs end margin. In Android, hyphenation is commonly used in text fields, such as the view-based system‚Äôs TextView, EditText or Jetpack Compose‚Äôs Text , TextField.\nBefore API 23 Up until API 23 Android OS didn‚Äôt have a support for automatic hyphenation. If the length of the word didn‚Äôt fit the original line, it would be moved to the next one below, thus, creating a huge space in the original line. This issue was noticed with the introduction of smartwatches, where the width of the screen is far smaller than a regular phone.\nSo what did Android Developers do to get the hyphenated effect? Soft-hyphen to rescue. Some of the popular options are ¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠\\u00AD, \\u200B, \u0026amp;#8211;, etc. Thanks to full UTF support on Android, the extensive use of SHY characters in strings.xml made the string reading in IDE unbearable, but gave the desired outcome.\nIntroduction of auto-hyphenation at API 23 Fast-forward to 2015, Android Marshmallow introduces the hyphenationFrequency attribution to TextView that will auto-hyphenate the words. The attribution comes with 3 values: normal , none , full .\n Algorithms and patterns for automatic hyphenation in Android are based on TeX , and are optimized for mobile use. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more, there is a fascinating talk about the whole typesetting system in Android.\n   normal frequency is often used for informal cases, like short sentences and chat messages. This value indicates light amount of automatic hyphenation.\n  none frequency indicates no automatic hyphenation. However, mid-word breaks may still happen when a word is wider than the layout, and there are no additional valid breaks within it. Note, soft hyphen is ignored in this value, and will not be used as a suggestion for potential line breaks.\n  full frequency is often to display a running text and/or maximum amount of text in a screen with limited space. This value indicates the full amount of automatic hyphenation, that is applicable in typography.\n  By default hyphenation frequency is set to normal . The change of the default frequency happens in the app‚Äôs theme.\nChange of defaults at API 29 In Android, setting a hyphenation frequency is an expensive operation. Use Android Text Like a Pro video from Android Dev Summit \u0026lsquo;18 explained the process very well. But, if you want to read up instead of watching, below is my essay of the video:\n Top layer:  Inside onMeasure() there is preliminary work which identifies width \u0026amp; height of the text and builds the layout of the textView. These processes then move down to native code to actually measure the text using open source libraries. All in all,\n More than 90% of the onMeasure() function is spent in native code to measure the text itself. *\n  Bottom Layer:  First, native code identifies words in the text. Then, for each word‚Äôs character it finds the shape and applies it to the character. It then brings all characters together in the word to adjust spacing between them and apply other character sequencing operations. The newly formed shape of the word is cached and used later in the onDraw() function of the TextView. The same is then repeated for the rest of the words. So,\n More than 90% of native code is spent to shape the text.*\n After it finishes text shaping, it applies line-breaking and hyphenation. Because hyphenation creates 2 or more words, native code applies text shaping all over to the newly created words.\nOften times, hyphenation is not needed for all TextViews. However the native code still runs the text shaping on them, thus impacting performance of the text layout. So, Android decided to set the default to none starting the API 29 (2019).\nNew values at API 33 Android Tiramisu (2022) introduces two more additional values for hyphenation frequency: normalFast and fullFast . With these values, the final outcome of the hyphenated text is the same as normal and full respectively, however the speed is different. The normalFast and fullfast values use a hyphenation optimized algorithm, that ignores some hyphen character related typographic features, e.g. kerning(aka spacing), therefore speeds up the performance with almost no impact on rendering.\nNow what? Handling hyphenation has come a long way on Android. If your app heavily relies on hyphenated words, especially in RecyclerView, I‚Äôd highly recommend to look into the PrecomputedText class, which moves the text measurement and shaping into a background thread, and returns the final result to a TextView‚Äôs setText() function.\n*the benchmark data is taken from the presentation .\n","date":"Apr 22, 2022","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/history_of_hyphenation_in_android/","series":null,"tags":["android"],"title":"History of Hyphenation in Android"},{"categories":["Android Development"],"content":" Table Of Contents:   1.

Featured in OnCreate Digest Issue #98.  Featured in Android Weekly Issue #508.  Featured in Jetpack Compose Resources Issue #106.  I find that the best way to learn anything is by replicating existing features. The flying hearts animation became quite popular when Instagram introduced a live-video feature. And I thought this could be a really good feature to practice animation in Jetpack Compose. Implementing the flying hearts animation (from Instagram live videos) in #JetpackCompose#AndroidDev pic.twitter.com/Wqi1PLuJJm\n\u0026mdash; Aida Issayeva üåª (@Aida_Isay) February 19, 2022  At first, it may seem like a complex animation, but if we look closer, for version 1 only two properties are used: visibility and the position of each heart. In this tutorial, I‚Äôll walk you through the implementation details of it, using the version 1.1.0-beta01 of Jetpack Compose.\n1. Drawing the heart shape In Jetpack Compose, there are multiple ways to apply a custom shape to a component. In the previous article , I wrote about leveraging the Shape API. In this one, I‚Äôll use Canvas API to have precise control over what‚Äôs drawn on the screen.\n Note: Canvas API of Jetpack Compose still hits the view-based Canvas API under the hood. However, it provides a more developer-friendly interface and takes care of managing states, performance, etc.\n The new Canvas API exposes DrawScope , a scoped drawing environment that provides sizing information and different transformations. The biggest benefit of using DrawScope in the new API is there is no longer a need for maintaining the underlying state of the Canvas . This means that creating and updating the objects happens in one place.\n1@Composable 2fun Heart() { 3 Canvas(modifier = Modifier 4 .fillMaxSize(), 5 onDraw = { 6 val path = Path().apply { 7 heartPath(Size(120f, 120f)) 8 } 9 10 drawPath( 11 path = path, 12 color = Color.Red, 13 ) 14 } 15 ) 16} The heart path extension is available here .\n2. Introducing the state For this animation, we have two states: Show and Hide .\n1enum class HeartState { 2 Show, 3 Hide 4} When the heart is shown, it will appear and move in the upward direction. When it‚Äôs in the hidden state, the heart disappears at the reached position.\nThe transition between states in the flying hearts is not fully user-controlled, the state change from Show to Hide happens automatically within a certain duration. To make that transition we‚Äôll use LaunchedEffect to swap the states:\n1 LaunchedEffect(key1 = state, block = { 2 state.value = when (state.value) { 3 HeartState.Show -\u0026gt; HeartState.Hide 4 HeartState.Hide -\u0026gt; HeartState.Show 5 } 6 }) 3. Adding Visibility animation Now with the state in place, we can start adding animations. The first property to animate is opacity, aka alpha in view-based and compose-based UI components. There are multiple ways to animate the appearance and disappearance of the element in Compose:\na) wrapping the element in high-level animation API AnimatedVisibility;\nb) leveraging Modifier function alpha to set the visibility of the element;\nc) using alpha parameter in drawPath() function to set the visibility of the Path.\nI went with the AnimatedVisibility API.\nWhen using AnimatedVisibility the entire content of the element will have the enter and exit animations. Under the hood, AnimatedVisibility creates a custom layout for the element and its content. Once the exit animation is completed, AnimatedVisibility removes the element and its content from the UI tree and then finally disposes.\n1 AnimatedVisibility( 2 visible = state.value == HeartState.Show, 3 enter = fadeIn(animationSpec = tween(durationMillis = 250)), 4 exit = fadeOut(animationSpec = tween(durationMillis = 700)), 5 ) { 6 Text(text = \u0026#34;This is a Text1\u0026#34;) 7 Text(text = \u0026#34;This is a Text2\u0026#34;) 8 } In the example above, both Texts will fade in at the same time and with the same easing.\nIn AnimatedVisibility only parameters visible and content are required. The parameters enter, exit, modifier, and label have default values. By default, the content appears by fading in and expanding, and it disappears by fading out and shrinking.\n4. Adding Position animation Now the next property to animate is the position of each heart. With each frame, the heart moves up. Let‚Äôs refresh our knowledge of the canvas coordinates system: the top start corner of the screen has (0,0) coordinates, while the bottom end has (width, height) coordinates. *The image is taken from @hi_man_shoe \u0026rsquo;s article \u0026ldquo;Understanding Canvas API in Android\u0026rdquo; .\nNow for the movement of the heart, we need two coordinates: start (x,y) and end (x1, y1). Because the heart goes up, the start coordinate will be in the bottom half of the screen, while the end coordinate in the top half.\nLet‚Äôs assume, for the start coordinate in X-axis, the animation will start at width/2 , and in Y-axis it‚Äôll start at height - (bottomMargin + buttonHeight).\nFor the end coordinate, let‚Äôs calculate random values, using Random generator class:\n1val yRandom = Random.nextInt(0, height / 2) 2val xRandom = Random.nextInt(0, width)) yRandom has a minimum value of zero, the top point of the screen, and a maximum value of height / 2 , the vertical center of the screen. xRandom has a minimum value of zero, the left point of the screen, and a maximum value of width , the right point of the screen.\nAs for animation, we can use low-level animation API animate*AsState function, specifically the animateDpAsState() :\n1 val offsetYAnimation: Dp by animateDpAsState( 2 targetValue = when (state.value) { 3 HeartState.Show -\u0026gt; height.dp 4 else -\u0026gt; yRandom 5 }, 6 animationSpec = tween(1000) 7 ) 1 val offsetXAnimation: Dp by animateDpAsState( 2 targetValue = when (state.value) { 3 HeartState.Show -\u0026gt; (width / 2).dp 4 else -\u0026gt; xRandom.dp 5 }, 6 animationSpec = tween(1000) 7 ) In animate*Float/Color/Dp/Size/Offset/Rect/Int/IntSize/IntOffset*AsState functions, only targetValue parameter is required, the rest have the default values.\nanimationSpec stores:\n  the data type to be animated;\n  the animation configuration, that will be used once the data has been converted to¬†AnimationVector .\n  In the example above, I used tween spec with default FastOutSlowInEasing.\n It‚Äôs worth noting that animate*AsState() is perfect for animating a single value. To animate multiple values it‚Äôs better to use updateTransition() that will return the instance of Transition. However, in this example, using transition gave me janky and earthquake-shaky animation.\n With the declared animation properties for the position, we can pass them to:\n  the translate() function of the Path ;\n  the transformation function translate() of the DrawScope ;\n  modifier function offset() of the canvas.\n  I chose the latter one:\n1 Canvas( 2 modifier = modifier 3 .offset(y = offsetYAnimation, x = offsetXAnimation) 4 ) 5. Making it multiple To make hearts appear on each click, we introduce the counter:\n1 val heartCount = remember { mutableStateOf(0) } On each button click, we‚Äôll increase the counter:\n1 Button( 2 onClick = { 3 heartCount.value++ 4 } 5 ) Then wrap the canvas into Kotlin‚Äôs repeat inline function:\n1 repeat(heartCount.value) { 2 Heart() 3 } 6. Additional animations The animation function animate*Float/Color/Dp/Size/Offset/Rect/Int/IntSize/IntOffset*AsState provides us out-of-the-box support for the extensive list of data types. We can introduce additional animation values and pass them to:\n  DrawScope ‚Äôs transformation functions like translate along the X and Y axes, scale in both vertical and horizontal directions, rotate to the current transform, etc.\n  DrawScope ‚Äôs regular functions like drawPath(), drawLine() , drawArc() , drawPoints() , etc where we can leverage color, alpha , sweepAngle and many other parameters.\n  Modifier ‚Äôs functions like background() , size() , border() , etc.\n  7. Clean up After making the animations work, it‚Äôs time to modify the code and introduce parameters to the Heart() composable function.\n  The first parameter is the Modifier to the Canvas component.\n  The second one is the horizontal padding for the left and right sides of the X-axis animation to narrow the horizontal axis for the shape swaying.\n  The third one is the bottom margin of the screen to determine the beginning of Y-axis animation.\n  Additionally, we can introduce the duration of the animations and other parameters.\nFull Code can be found here .\n8. What‚Äôs next? After making the animation work, my view-based brain couldn‚Äôt stop but wonder about the performance of adding and removing the layout for every single heart. So I decided to optimize the code, and draw as many paths as the button clicked using the repeat function or simple for-loop inside onDraw() function of Canvas, but after days of trying to make it work, I figured it was time to take a nice break and write this article.\nIf you know the solution, please share it with me in the comments or on Twitter.

How to apply Shape? Create a custom shape Final Thoughts    Featured in Android Weekly Issue #504.  Featured in Jetpack Compose Resources Issue #103.   Oftentimes, we get asked to create different custom views and shapes in Android Development. In the old view-based system, we heavily relied on Canvas to create a shape. Luckily, Jetpack Compose introduces new out-of-the-box ways to easily create and modify shapes on the fly.\nThis post will walk you through the available standard shapes in Compose Foundation and how you can leverage them for your needs or create custom ones.\nWhat is Shape? In Jetpack compose Shape is an interface to define the form, contours, or outline of an object.\nTwo classes implement the Shape interface:\n  CornerBasedShape creates a rectangle defined by four CornerSizes. CornerSize can accept dp, px, and percent values. CornerBasedShape is a parent class to four shapes:\n RoundedCornerShape and AbsoluteRoundedCornerShape are used to define a rectangle with rounded corners. RoundedCornerShape is layout-direction aware(LayoutDirection.Rtl ) and automatically mirrors the corner sizes.  In the example above, the same parameters for RoundedCornerShape returned a different shape based on the system\u0026rsquo;s layout direction.\nIf you‚Äôd like to disregard it - use AbsoluteRoundedCornerShape .\n CutCornerShape and AbsoluteCutCornerShape both define a rectangle with cut corners. Similar to RoundedCornerShape, CutCornerShape is layout-direction aware and automatically mirrors the corner sizes. Use AbsoluteCutCornerShape if layout direction needs to be disregarded.    GenericShape creates a custom shape by applying the provided builder on a Path. More details are below.\n  The shape component also comes with two top-level properties, that don‚Äôt require any parameters:\n RectangleShape to apply a rectangle form; CircleShape to apply a circle form.  1val circleShape = CircleShape 2val rectangleShape = RectangleShape How to apply Shape? The shape can be applied to most Compose Elements and Layouts via Modifier. Several Modifier functions accept shape:\n  clip(shape) is an extension function, that will clip content to a selected shape. Under the hood, it hits graphicsLayer() function.\n  graphicsLayer() is a function, that applies different effects to content such as rotation, scaling, clipping, and shadow.\n  background(color, shape) is a function, that will apply the selected shape to the background and won‚Äôt affect the content.\n  border(width, color, shape) is a function, that will apply the selected shape to the border.\n  drawBehind() is a function that will draw the selected path behind the content. This function does not exactly accept Shape class, however, it provides a stateless API DrawScope to draw shapes and paths without requiring developers to maintain Canvas state. You can pass the Path of a shape to drawPath() function inside.\n  You can also combine any of the above functions simultaneously to get the most desired outcome. For example, to re-create a CircularImageView of the old view-based system in Jetpack Compose, you can leverage graphicsLayer and border functions:\n1val circleShape = CircleShape 2 Image( 3 painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.jetpack_compose_logo), 4 contentDescription = \u0026#34;Jetpack Compose Logo\u0026#34;, 5 modifier = Modifier 6 .size(150.dp) 7 .graphicsLayer { // call this function to apply custom shadow elevation, otherwise use `clip()` 8 shadowElevation = Dimensions.medium.toPx() //your custom shadow elevation in px 9 clip = true //make sure to set clip to true 10 shape = circleShape 11 } 12 .background( 13 color = colorResource(id = R.color.cupsOfCode_dark_green) 14 ) 15 .border( 16 border = BorderStroke( 17 width = 3.dp, 18 color = colorResource(id = R.color.cupsofCode_brown) 19 ), shape = circleShape 20 ) 21 22 ) The result is: Create a custom shape To create a custom shape, you can:\n a) create a custom class by implementing the Shape interface and overriding its createOutline function  or\n b) use GenericShape and pass a builder lambda to it. Under the hood, GenericShape overrides the createOutline function of Shape .  For example, to create a heart, I‚Äôve converted this logic from StackOverFlow into an extension function heartPath() of Path (ext function is here ). Then you can use the first option and create a custom class Heart :\n1class Heart: Shape { 2 override fun createOutline( 3 size: Size, 4 layoutDirection: LayoutDirection, 5 density: Density 6 ): Outline { 7 val path = Path().apply { 8 heartPath(size = size) 9 close() 10 } 11 return Outline.Generic(path) 12 } 13} Or use the second option with GenericShape :\n1@Composable 2fun heart(): GenericShape { 3 return GenericShape { size, _ -\u0026gt; 4 heartPath(size = size) 5 } 6} Both options will return a heart shape:\n Note: when using GenericShape you don‚Äôt need to call close() function of the Path, because it‚Äôs already taken care of.\n Final Thoughts Shape API in Jetpack Compose provides quick solutions for complex UI elements. Unlike the old view-based system, Shape API doesn‚Äôt require additional vector XML files or deep-dive access to Canvas and the customization of most components can be done directly on them via available Modifier functions. So, give it a try and spend some time playing with it.\nThanks for reading!

Hope the upcoming year will bring us joy, health, and happiness!\n","date":"Dec 31, 2021","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/2021_review/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"2021 Year in Review"},{"categories":["Android Development"],"content":" Table Of Contents:   Implementation Testing  Manual Testing Unit Testing      Last year, Android introduced a new in-app review API that would allow users to review and rate an app within the app itself. Meaning, developers no longer have to worry about keeping track of how many times the ‚ÄúRate Us‚Äù dialog has been displayed to users and whether the users clicked to go Play Store App.\nThe intention of this API is to remove overhead on developers and keep users in the app with respect to their privacy. However, from a developer standpoint, there are a couple of prerequisites to keep in mind while integrating the in-app review API.\n  Your app‚Äôs applicationId must at least be available in the internal track on Google Play, otherwise the in-app review will never appear.\n  Displaying a review bottomsheet is not guaranteed. Play Core handles the logic of how many times the bottomsheet will be displayed to a user, whether the user has interacted with the bottomsheet, and whether the user has already submitted a review. The API only exposes one listener to notify whether we should proceed with the regular flow in the app. Thus, all this handling done by the API causes end-to-end testing to become difficult.\n  In this tutorial, I‚Äôll walk you through the integration of the in-app review API in MVI fashion.\nImplementation Prerequisites of this tutorial:\n RxJava Dagger MVI (model-view-intent)  Let‚Äôs dive into details:\nStep 1:\nAdd the following dependencies into the build.gradle file of your desired feature:\n1// This dependency is downloaded from Google‚Äôs Maven repository. 2// So, make sure you also include that repository in your project\u0026#39;s build.gradle file. 3implementation \u0026#39;com.google.android.play:core:1.10.2\u0026#39; 4 5// For Kotlin users also import the Kotlin extensions library for Play Core: 6implementation \u0026#39;com.google.android.play:core-ktx:1.8.1\u0026#39; Step 2:\nCreate an instance of ReviewManager inside the desired feature‚Äôs dagger module:\n1@Provides 2@Singleton 3fun providesReviewManager(): ReviewManager { 4 return ReviewManagerFactory.create(context) 5} Step 3:\nInject the instance into the feature‚Äôs viewmodel: 1class ActivityViewModel @Inject constructor( 2 private val navigator: Navigator, 3 private val reviewManager: ReviewManager 4) : ViewModel() {\nStep 4:\nIn this step we introduce the logic of triggering the in-app review. Due to the quota limitations, Play Console advises not to have any call-to-action option that triggers the API. So the best way to trigger it will be after completing a couple of levels in a game, and/or after the user becomes familiar with the app and has used it for quite a while.\nIn my example, I don‚Äôt have too much complicated logic implemented. Rather, I\u0026rsquo;m just triggering the API after the 5th,10th, and 20th session. Session numbers are saved in shared preferences.\n1Single.create\u0026lt;ReviewInfo\u0026gt; { emitter -\u0026gt; 2 val session = sharedPreferences.getInt(SESSION, 1) 3 if (session == 5 || session == 10 || session == 20) { 4 val reviewInfo = reviewManager.requestReviewFlow() 5 reviewInfo.addOnCompleteListener { task -\u0026gt; 6 if (task.isSuccessful) { 7 emitter.onSuccess(task.result) 8 } else { 9 emitter.onError(Throwable(task.exception)) 10 } 11 12 } 13 } else { 14 emitter.onError(Throwable(\u0026#34;no time to request in-app review\u0026#34;)) 15 } 16}.map\u0026lt;ActivityIntent\u0026gt; { 17 ActivityIntent.InAppReviewRequested(it) 18}.onErrorReturn { error -\u0026gt; 19 //If this throws an error, do you need to display it to a user? Not really. 20 // We can just log an error. 21 ActivityIntent.NoOp 22}.toObservable() If the session is 5th, 10th or 20th, request a review flow from ReviewManager (line 4). Add a complete listener to the request. If the request is successful, we can go ahead and launch the review flow on UI. If not, we emit the error, but do nothing with it (when mapping, the error is converted into NoOp intent that doesn‚Äôt change or update the viewstate).\nStep 5:\nIn the reducer, pass the reviewInfo object which is used to launch the flow, to the state:\n1is ActivityIntent.InAppReviewRequested -\u0026gt; { 2 previous.copy(reviewInfo = intent.reviewInfo) 3} Step 6: In the subscriber, listen to the changes and if reviewInfo object exists inside the viewstate, launch the flow:\n1viewState.reviewInfo?.run { 2 val review = reviewManager.launchReviewFlow(this@MainActivity, this) 3 review.addOnCompleteListener { 4 intentsSubject.onNext(ActivityIntent.InAppReviewCompleted) 5 } 6} After the review flow is completed(note: even at this point, it is not guaranteed whether the bottomsheet will appear or not), trigger the InAppReviewCompleted intent to continue on with the regular flow. In our viewmodel, where intents are bounded, handle the InAppReviewCompleted :\n1it.ofType(ActivityIntent.InAppReviewCompleted::class.java) 2 .flatMapCompletable { 3 //after receiving a signal that review flow ended, we proceed with regular flow 4 navigator.navigateTo(NavigatorPath.Feed) 5 }.toObservable\u0026lt;ActivityIntent\u0026gt;() Testing Manual Testing For manual testing, make sure an account has not reviewed the app yet. If so - delete the review and add the account email into the internal test tracking group. Then, proceed to distribute the internal test build to your test group. There is a great walkthrough of in-app review manual testing by John Codeos.\nUnit Testing I‚Äôve noticed in many blog posts about in-app review API, the unit testing is not fully covered and only briefly mentioned. It will not be the case with this post üòâ.\nFor mocking in unit tests, I use Mockk library. 1implementation \u0026#39;io.mockk:mockk:1.10.2\u0026#39;\nInside the ViewModelTest, create a mock instance of FakeReviewManager:\n1private val reviewManager: FakeReviewManager = mockk(relaxed = true) Then mock the instance of the task and reviewInfo: 1val mockReviewInfo = mockk\u0026lt;ReviewInfo\u0026gt;(relaxed = true) 2val mockReviewInstance = mockk\u0026lt;Task\u0026lt;ReviewInfo\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(relaxed = true)\nThen mock the successful behavior of reviewInfo and task instances:\n1//given 2every { mockReviewInstance.isSuccessful } returns true 3every { mockReviewInstance.result } returns mockReviewInfo 4every { reviewManager.requestReviewFlow() } returns mockReviewInstance 5 6val slot = slot\u0026lt;OnCompleteListener\u0026lt;ReviewInfo\u0026gt;\u0026gt;() 7every { mockReviewInstance.addOnCompleteListener(capture(slot)) } answers { 8 slot.captured.onComplete(mockReviewInstance) 9 mockReviewInstance 10} Set up a list of expected viewstates: 1//given 2val expectedViewStates = arrayOf( 3 ViewState(), 4 ViewState().copy(reviewInfo = mockReviewInfo) 5)\nThen check values of actual and expected view states: 1//when 2val resultsObserver = activityViewModel.bind(intentSubject).test() 3 4//then 5resultsObserver.assertValues(*expectedViewStates)\nFor failed state, mock the failed behavior by tweaking the return:\n1//given 2every { mockReviewInstance.isSuccessful } returns false 3every { mockReviewInstance.result } returns mockReviewInfo 4every { mockReviewInstance.exception } returns Exception(Unsuccessful_Task) 5every { reviewManager.requestReviewFlow() } returns mockReviewInstance Protip: the same style of detailed mocking Task and Object can be applied with other Google products like Firebase, Play Core, etc.   The full integration PR can be found here with unit tests in place.\nI hope this post was helpful.

Featured in Dev Weekly Issue #106.   So you want to become an Android Developer and don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start?\nHere is my 5-step guide to becoming an Android Developer, jam-packed with action items after each step.\n  Presentation . \n  Video:      Table Of Contents:   1. Learn a Programming Language 2. Learn Android Platform Fundamentals 3. Get to know the Tools 4. Contribute to Open Source 5. Share Your Learnings Conclusion    1. Learn a Programming Language Learning and knowing a programming language is essential in software engineering. There are two primary languages used in Android Development: Java and Kotlin. If you‚Äôre thinking about what to learn? Hint: it should be Kotlin   Kotlin is a first-class language for writing android apps. Why? It has an extensive list of features that help developers with day-to-day coding. It reduces the tedious boilerplate code developers have to write - meaning increased productivity. It helps to write safer code, which means fewer mistakes and crashes. And it is also Java language compatible - meaning developers can call java-based code from Kotlin or vice-versa.\nWhen learning Kotlin, there are 3 pillars you should focus on:\n Syntax and idioms OOP (Object-oriented programming) Data structures and algorithms  Todo action items are on slide 5 .\n2. Learn Android Platform Fundamentals Android development is impossible without knowing the fundamentals of its platform. The platform itself consists of multiple different components. But the essentials to start developing apps include:\n App Components, Views, and Intents Context Handling app configuration changes Unit testing Multithreading Security Navigation  Todo action items are on slide 7 .\nOnce you‚Äôve completed the essentials, the good to know topics are dependency injection and 3rd party libraries, and so on‚Ä¶\n3. Get to know the Tools Three most important tools every Android developer should know how to use: Android Studio as your go-to IDE, Git as your go-to version control system, and Gradle as your go-to build automation tool.\nAndroid Studio is the official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for building android apps. It‚Äôs based on top of IntelliJ‚Äôs IDEA and has tons of developer tools and features that help you write android apps for mobile phones, TVs, watches, auto, etc.\nVersion Control Systems (VCS) are designed to track changes in the codebase, coordinate work among developers, and allow them to reference older versions later. There are multiple types of VCS that exist, but the most popular one is Git. The popular repository hosting service for git is Github .\nGradle is a build automation tool to build, compile and publish apps. It‚Äôs already built-in in Android Studio.\nTodo action items are on slide 9 .\n Would you prefer courses? Then checkout which course will suit you best here .\n 4. Contribute to Open Source Contributing to open-source projects might be a very time-consuming task, but it has some important outcomes that beginners can benefit from. It helps you learn more about projects, improves your coding skills, and helps the community and your peers get to know you. This recognition can bring a lot of opportunities in your career.\nYou don‚Äôt need to select a big, established open source project. It could be a small project that caught your eye on Github . In fact, most projects on Github are open to the public, therefore you can contribute to them.\nThere are many ways to contribute:\n Found a bug in a project? Open an issue! Found a typo in the documentation or there is an undocumented method? Open a pull request with the fix! A project has some open pull requests? Review them! Have a solution for one of the open issues? Open a pull request with the fix or new feature!  and so on\u0026hellip;\nTodo action items are on slide 11 .\n5. Share Your Learnings Did you build a Hello World app? - Share it! Share everything from your perspective on Android development, to where you seem to struggle most while learning to build apps.\n The biggest benefit of sharing at the beginning of your career is that it‚Äôll keep you accountable to code a little bit every day, thus learning something new every day.\n Most beginners drop out here because they feel alone in this journey. But the actual truth is if you struggle, then there are others struggling too. Talk with others about your learning journey.\nOne place to put yourself out there is Twitter. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable or shy putting yourself out there, start with Reddit, GDG local groups, Meetup, and share your experience there. When you join communities, it‚Äôll help you to overcome the fear of asking for help. Thus, help you to grow as a developer.\nTodo action items are on slide 13 .\nConclusion The journey of becoming an Android Developer usually begins with learning a programming language. Kotlin is a recommended language for android app development.\nThen it goes to learning the android platform fundamentals, understanding how an app communicates with the system itself, how the navigation is enforced, etc.\nAfter learning the fundamentals, it‚Äôs time to start writing some code for an android project. And it‚Äôs impossible without knowing the tools that will help you write, publish and share the source code. The essentials are Android Studio, Git, and Gradle.\nThe last two steps are about accelerating and exposing you as a developer to the android community. Contributing to open-source projects help you to become familiarized with various codebases, write better code, and communicate with other contributors.\nLast, but not least is sharing. Share your journey, learnings, and frustrations, because when you share, you keep yourself accountable to code a bit every day. And most importantly, to learn something new!\nOk, that\u0026rsquo;s the wrap!\nNow go and start coding!\n","date":"Sep 29, 2021","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/the_five_step_guide_to_become_android_developer/","series":null,"tags":["early career"],"title":"The 5-Step Guide to Become an Android Developer"},{"categories":["Web Development"],"content":"After 2 years of using the NewsRoom theme on Hugo, I wanted to switch themes and use something new. With Bootstrap theme as my ideal choice, I decided to nosedive into migrating over until I was faced with my first blocker\u0026hellip; upgrading Hugo to its latest version.\nMy current Hugo version: 0.61.0\nThe new theme‚Äôs minimum required version: 0.75.0\nWhat could be so interesting about upgrading Hugo that I decided to write a blog post about it? Well, like most SDK upgrades, there\u0026rsquo;s always more than meets the eye. Thus for Hugo, a seemingly five second version bump quickly spiraled into countless minutes of troubleshooting and debugging.\nTo upgrade Hugo, I ran brew install hugo , which inevitably auto-updated my Homebrew version and downloaded the latest Hugo version.\nThen, the error about an another version is already linked decided to pop up: After some research, the error is thrown because homebrew core and task folders are shallow clones: This might cause a homebrew update if it\u0026rsquo;s too old. Given the latest changes on GitHub to restrict large repositories from auto-updating shallow clones, you might need to manually update Homebrew and links to the appropriate folders.\nAfter updating, you should run these two commands back to back:\n1git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow 1git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask fetch --unshallow The next step is to unlink the existing version of Hugo from homebrew via the following command:\n1brew unlink hugo then link Hugo again so it can point to the latest version:\n1brew link hugo Voila! Now Hugo is successfully updated to its latest version.\nStay tuned for a blog post about migrating themes in Hugo.\n","date":"Sep 8, 2021","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/story_of_upgrading_hugo/","series":null,"tags":["hugo","web"],"title":"Story of Upgrading Hugo"},{"categories":["Web Development"],"content":"Link in Bio landing pages became very popular since Instagram limited only single URL per profile info. Luckily, Hugo makes creating those social landing pages a walk in the park. It\u0026rsquo;s so simple, that in just under 10 minutes, you\u0026rsquo;ll have your own custom Link in Bio page up and running.\n Table Of Contents:   Shortcode in Hugo Shortcode structure and parameters How to access a parameter in shortcode Custom shortcode in Hugo Embed Bio Link from Canva Hugo shortcode template result Gotchas Conclusion    Shortcode in Hugo For building custom UI templates (in our case it‚Äôs a custom Link in Bio), Hugo provides shortcodes .\nA shortcode is a simple snippet inside a content file that Hugo will render using a predefined template.\nHugo already comes with neat built-in shortcodes that you can use to embed videos, images, tweets, etc.\nShortcode structure and parameters In a nutshell, shortcode is a HTML file with a custom layout. So it‚Äôs structured the same way as any html file. Shortcodes can be updated anytime to reflect new classes, techniques, or standards. At the point of site generation, Hugo shortcodes will easily merge the changes together.\nIn Shortcode, there are three types of parameters that can be utilized:\n Named parameters, which are parameters with custom names given by you. While using shortcode, the amount of parameters you create can add up. So it\u0026rsquo;s always best to name them to avoid confusion down the road. Positional parameter, which is a parameter based on the position. Flexible parameter, which is used whenever you‚Äôd like to set a default value to a parameter that can be later overridden by others.  How to access a parameter in shortcode In a shortcode file(html file), all of its parameters can be accessed via the .Get method. To access a named parameter, call:\n1{{ .Get \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; }} To access a second positional parameter, call:\n1{{ .Get 1 }} For the first positional parameter - 0 should be passed, and so on.\nCustom shortcode in Hugo To create own custom shortcode follow the steps:\nStep 1:\nCreate a shortcodes folder inside the layouts folder: layouts/shortcodes\nStep 2:\nInside the shortcodes folder, create a HTML file with the desired UI elements; The name of the HTML file will be the name of the custom shortcode(without the .html extension) .\nCustom html:\n1{{- $msg := .Get 0 -}} 2 3\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;social-link\u0026#34; \u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;img style=\u0026#34;max-width: 100%\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;/images/social_background.jpg\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;button-container\u0026#34; \u0026gt; 6 7 \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;social-button main-color\u0026#34;\u0026gt;‚ú® {{ $msg }} ‚ú®\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 8 9 \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;social-button dark-accent\u0026#34;\u0026gt;üíØ Text 2 üíØ\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 10 11 \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;social-button dark-shade\u0026#34;\u0026gt;üéâ Text 3 üéâ\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 12 13 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;social-media-container\u0026#34; \u0026gt; 14 \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;social-button light-shade\u0026#34;\u0026gt;üìπ Text 4 üìπ\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 15 \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;social-button light-shade\u0026#34;\u0026gt;üì∏ Text 5 üì∏\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 16 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 17 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 18 19\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Note: $msg is a variable and the value of it is a shortcode parameter at position 0.\nStep 3:\nProvide custom css properties in assets/css or assets/scss to the html elements.\nStep 4:\nCreate a content file(.md). If you‚Äôd like to place the social landing page right after your domain name (veryCoolWebsite.com/social), then the content file should be placed in the contents folder.\nStep 5:\nUse a newly created shortcode in your content file( .md)\n1{{\u0026lt; nameOfTheShortCodeFromFolder parameters \u0026gt;}} Shortcode parameters are space delimited, and parameters with internal spaces can be quoted.\nExample:\n1{{\u0026lt; social_link \u0026#34;Read my latest blog post\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Step 6:\nSave the changes and check the results on your localhost. You might need to tweak css here and there, however at this point, you‚Äôve completed creating your custom Bio Link page üëèüëèüëè!\nEmbed Bio Link from Canva If creating an html file, positioning the elements, and applying css values is not your cup of tea; you can always opt-in to design solutions out there. For example, Canva has a list of great templates for Bio Link. And you can publish any of the templates as a website.\nNow here is a neat little trick on Canva: after publishing, you can copy the embed code and place it in your custom shortcode file(step 2). To do so, follow the steps:\n Click on the ‚ÄúCreate Design‚Äù button on the top right corner of Canva \u0026rsquo;s homepage, and search for ‚ÄúBio Link‚Äù. Choose a template and edit as you desire. Click on ‚ÄúPublish as Website‚Äù on the top right corner (the website should be published at this point). Click on Three Dots on the top right corner. Search for ‚Äúembed‚Äù and select it. Copy ‚ÄúHTML embed code‚Äù. Place the copied snippet into the custom shortcode html file.  With this solution you don‚Äôt need to worry about colors, text, etc. Plus you don‚Äôt need to deploy anything, you can just edit your canva file.\nJust like Canva, there are millions of other solutions out there that can be used for your unique design.\nHugo shortcode template result If you‚Äôd like to see the final result of my custom Link in Bio, check out my social page .\nGotchas Although the actual building and deploying took less than 10 minutes, there were obviously some gotchas that made me go through rabbit hole of issues on the web:\n Shortcodes will not work in template files . They work in content files (inside the content folder) background-image that I set on my parent container div unfortunately wasn‚Äôt picked up by mobile browsers(Google chrome or mobile Safari) on either iOS or Android. Found online, some people using hugo reported the issue that is basically linked all the way to browsers' issue . Apparently this has been a known issue in the web community since the bug was opened more than 10 years ago. I tried to override background-attachment, set background-position, modify background-size , but nothing worked. The image still refused to appear on mobile devices.  Instead of setting background-image on container, I decided to add img child to my container:\n1\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;container\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 3\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/social_background.jpg\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 4 5.... buttons.... 6 7\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; In css set the height of the container to be 100%:\n1.container { 2 position: relative; 3 height: 100%; 4 width: 100%; 5} And it worked üéâ!\nLesson learned: In Hugo (I assume everywhere in web as well) if you want to apply custom background image to your container, DON‚ÄôT go for the obvious solution to set background-image property - create a separate img element inside the container.\nConclusion Shortcodes are code snippets that can be instrumental in creating eye-catching and interactive UI elements for your content. And by following the above steps, you‚Äôll be able to have your Link in Bio up and running in no time.\n","date":"Aug 9, 2021","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/how_to_build_custom_link_in_bio_landing_social_page/","series":null,"tags":["hugo","web"],"title":"How to Create Your Custom Link in Bio Landing Page in Hugo Under 10 Mins"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"Finding a job is never easy - finding the first job is a thousand times harder. Getting those automatic rejection emails without having a chance to interview can be an emotional roller-coaster that makes you doubt your skills, abilities, and intentions. This is why striving for visibility is key when trying to land that first job interview.\nThe greater the number of people who view your resume, the greater the chance of being offered an interview - it\u0026rsquo;s as simple as that. Thus knowing how to be visible in a sea of other candidates like yourself is detrimental to getting a positive response to your application.\nHere are three tips that will help you stand out and be invited to the technical rounds of interviews.\n Table Of Contents:   1. New Grad, Internship, and Returnship sections in career page 2. Quantity over quality 3. Make Github your best friend    1. New Grad, Internship, and Returnship sections in career page Every major company has separate sections for:\n New grads [for people who graduated last year or are going to graduate in the upcoming summer] Internships [for students who are still in the process of getting their knowledge] Returnships [for people who left the workplace for some time and now they‚Äôre returning back].  There are usually deadlines when to apply based on the company. If deadlines are not mentioned - you can get in touch with the recruiting team(every career page has some sort of \u0026ldquo;Contact us\u0026rdquo; section). In the case of a missing \u0026ldquo;contact us\u0026rdquo; page - then you can get in touch with the company via social media. This will help you get in the bucket with the rest of the new grads.\nIf you have no experience, not even an internship - I suggest adding a small note alongside your application that states you\u0026rsquo;re open for one. The response rate works well with smaller companies, where hiring managers directly review the application.\n2. Quantity over quality Apply at as many places as possible. Don\u0026rsquo;t disregard small companies.\nSet a goal to apply to at least 20 companies a day. Set a goal to keep reapplying to the same company if needed.\nIt all may seem repetitive and/or redundant, but as mentioned earlier, recruiting is a number\u0026rsquo;s game - so the point is to get visible.\n3. Make Github your best friend Aside from learning the essentials of the git version control system, you should also focus on capitalizing Github ‚Äôs wonderful exposure to the programming world. Being publicly active on Github shows tech recruiters and observing developers that you‚Äôre genuinely interested in programming. So here are 2 ways how you can do just that:\n  Reporting/fixing issues on open-source projects whether it‚Äôs through code changes or through documentation (even if it‚Äôs just grammar corrections), is a great way to show that you‚Äôre ready to contribute to a company‚Äôs product.\n  Creating your own project from scratch and pushing it to Github is probably the most important requirement for achieving the best visibility possible. Just ensure you treat this personal project with standard industry practices such as not committing private API keys, leaving adequate documentation, formatting your code, unit tests, etc.\n   Remember, it took Thomas Jefferson 1000 failed attempts to make a light bulb. Similarly, it may take you 1000 rejections before finally getting a job offer.\nIt won\u0026rsquo;t be easy, but by persistently following the above tips, your visibility to recruiters will shine exponentially, and with it, your chances of landing that job interview!\n P.S.

Table Of Contents:   Disposable CompositeDisposable SerialDisposable Conclusion    Disposable RxJava 2 introduced the concept of Disposables .\nDisposables are streams/links/connections between Observer and Observable. They\u0026rsquo;re meant to give power to the Observers to control Observables. In most cases, the Observer is a UI element, ie; Fragment, Activity, or a corresponding viewmodel of those elements. While Observable represents a data flow where data can be passed from one source to another and get modified along the way if needed.\nSometimes that data flow can be long-running api requests, or can be listening to the updates in the database, and by the time you get a response or a value gets emitted - the screen that made a request might already be closed. In this case, you might end up with a memory leak, or even a crash - depending on your implementation.\nSo in order to avoid these issues, it is important that ui elements which are aware of Android Lifecycles, dispose their data flows when they‚Äôre not needed anymore, even if no response was emitted yet. That\u0026rsquo;s where Disposable comes handy.\nDisposable itself is an interface that comes with dispose() and isDisposed() functions. In RxJava 1 there was a Subscription interface that had the same functionality. RxJava 3 introduced additional operations .\nThis is how to declare and assign a disposable within a Fragment:\n1 private lateinit var disposable: Disposable 2 3 override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { 4 super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState) 5 6 disposable = api.getPosts() 7 .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) 8 .subscribe({ posts -\u0026gt; 9 println(posts) 10 }, { throwable -\u0026gt; 11 println(throwable) 12 }) 13 } And below is the sample code to dispose the observable when the fragment\u0026rsquo;s view is destroyed; therefore, there is no subscriber listening to the changes:\n1 override fun onDestroyView() { 2 if(this::disposable.isInitialized \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !disposable.isDisposed) { 3 disposable.dispose() 4 } 5 super.onDestroyView() 6 } CompositeDisposable As an app evolves and grows, it may require getting data from multiple sources. For example, Instagram Feed screen has the endpoint to get the list of the posts and another endpoint to get the list of stories(you can notice how these two parts get updated asynchronously and don\u0026rsquo;t depend on each other üòâ). The list of additional data flows can be big or small.\nInstead of declaring and initializing each disposable for those data flows, RxJava 2 introduced a CompositeDisposable class to bundle multiple Disposables that can be disposed all at once. It\u0026rsquo;s basically the class that holds a collection of disposables and also offers O(1) time complexity for add(Disposable), remove(Disposable), delete(Disposable) operations.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s continue with the example above, and add getStories() call:\n1 private val compositeDisposable by lazy { 2 CompositeDisposable() 3 } 4 5 override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { 6 super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState) 7 8 compositeDisposable.add( 9 api.getPosts() 10 .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) 11 .subscribe({ posts -\u0026gt; 12 println(posts) 13 }, { throwable -\u0026gt; 14 println(throwable) 15 }) 16 ) 17 18 compositeDisposable.add( 19 api.getStories() 20 .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) 21 .subscribe({ stories -\u0026gt; 22 println(stories) 23 }, { throwable -\u0026gt; 24 println(throwable) 25 }) 26 ) 27 } Upon onDestroyView() the CompositeDisposable gets cleared:\n1 override fun onDestroyView() { 2 compositeDisposable.clear() 3 super.onDestroyView() 4 } Unlike Disposable, CompositeDisposable has two ways of disposing subscriptions:\n dispose() clear()  Both operations dispose the previously contained subscriptions, but dispose() operation assigns true to the disposed variable, which later does not let you add, remove,or delete any other disposables.\nIf you have CompositeDisposable in fragments, then you should call clear() upon onDestroyView() because the fragment doesn\u0026rsquo;t get destroyed. It goes to the backstack, therefore you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create a new instance of CompositeDisposable every time when a fragment\u0026rsquo;s view is re-created.\nIf you have CompositeDisposable in activities, then call dispose() upon onDestroy().\nSerialDisposable While CompositeDisposable is quite popular due to its convenience, there is the lesser known SerialDisposable class, that RxJava 2 introduced. SerialDisposable is a disposable container that allows atomically updating/replacing the contained Disposable with another Disposable, disposing the old one when updating, and handling the disposition when the container itself is disposed.\nOr simply, whenever you want to replace the existing subscription with the new one - use SerialDisposable.\nFor example, Instagram has a search functionality where their api returns results for each search query. A user first typed in fru in EditText, saw an empty screen, and then finished typing the whole word fruits. Since there could be cases of unstable internet connections which can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee the order of network request/responses, in our use case, the first response came back for fruits, then the second response was for fru. Because the second response was the last response - ui renders the results of fru, which is confusing for the user since they now see more broader results than the specific fruits results.\nIn order to prevent these confusions, it\u0026rsquo;s better to use set() operation of SerialDisposable, which sets the latest disposable whenever the request happened and disposes the previous one:\n1 private val serialDisposable by lazy { 2 SerialDisposable() 3 } 4 5 override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { 6 super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState) 7 8 view.editText.doAfterTextChanged { text -\u0026gt; 9 serialDisposable.set( 10 api.searchFor(text) 11 .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) 12 .subscribe({ result -\u0026gt; 13 println(result) 14 }, { throwable -\u0026gt; 15 println(throwable) 16 }) 17 ) 18 } 19 } Operation replace() on the other hand, does not dispose the previous disposable, which means the result of it will be emitted upon subscribe().\nThink of SeriaDisposable  as a manual version of switchMap() operator, that you can use to glue your ui callbacks and reactive data flows.\nConclusion In conclusion, ui elements can subscribe to observables and decide when to listen to its changes and when not to. Whenever the ui element gets removed from the content view, it\u0026rsquo;s important to dispose all of its subscriptions, otherwise they will cause a memory leak.\nRxJava provides Disposable to manage the subscriptions. It also has CompositeDisposable and SerialDisposable classes that implement Disposable.\nCompositeDisposable is a container that can hold multiple disposables and dispose them all at once.\nSerialDisposable is a container that is used to replace the current disposable with the new one.\n I hope this post was helpful.

In the sea of options, it‚Äôs important to understand what will help you be ready in the professional workplace and excel in programming.\nWhile there are some teachers that can explain the concept well, you may leave the class asking yourself how can you apply this knowledge. And it‚Äôs because these teachers don‚Äôt have the experience building and shipping professional apps. It‚Äôs like knowing all theory, but not actual practice.\nThere are also some great professionals who share their knowledge and tutorials (mostly on Udemy) that are so advanced, it may leave you wondering whether you‚Äôre capable of learning anything or not. And it‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs the profesional. Unfortunately, some senior developers forget what it was like to be a beginner. Thus, they create tutorials to solve problems while falsely assuming that their reader knows the underlying framework to their proposed solution\nAnd that‚Äôs why finding a truly great course, that will help you excel at learning and understanding software development is very important. I really like what Udacity has been doing so far. They combine both, teacher and professional perspectives, to help you learn properly.\n In fact, I liked their approach so much that last year I decided to collaborate with them in making an Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree . The main difference of the nanodegree is at the end of each lesson and chapter there are projects, that have been developed by professionals, like me, based on the previous experience building and releasing apps.\n And to be honest with you, it was not easy to explain things in plain English without any technical jargon. With tremendous help from Udacity, we‚Äôve nailed down the course, so everyone can just take it and start building their own Android apps. Make sure to check out the degree , and if you have any questions about ‚ÄúAdvanced Android Apps with Kotlin, Part 1‚Äù, just ping me, because I worked on it =).\nFor those, who are in the beginning of their journey to become an Android Developer, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend looking at \u0026ldquo;Android Basics\u0026rdquo; . It covers all the basics of Android Framework and it will help you to get comfortable with Android.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking to swing to the dark side and become an iOS Developer, then definitely check out this nanodegree .\nSoftware development is a continuous education. Don‚Äôt assume after finishing these nanodegrees, you‚Äôll know everything. It is just the beginning. You‚Äôll learn so much as you go, and that‚Äôs the beauty of working as a developer - you get paid to keep learning.\n","date":"Mar 15, 2021","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/courses/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"How to Choose Mobile App Development Course Online?"},{"categories":["Android Development"],"content":"These days, most startup apps heavily rely on third-party libraries to send push notifications to a user, thus causing developers to usually not pay too much attention to Android notification changes.\nFor example, I was working on my side-project which sends a notification once the download is completed (was checking how DownloadManager works).\nBack in 2016, you\u0026rsquo;d need to initialize NotificationManager and pending intent if notification contains custom action:\n1private lateinit var notificationManager: NotificationManager 2private lateinit var pendingIntent: PendingIntent 3 4override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { 5 ... 6 notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager 7 8 val intent = Intent(this, DetailActivity::class.java) 9 pendingIntent = 10 PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 1, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT) 11} And then after download is complete, you\u0026rsquo;d need to build the notification, include pendingIntent and send it to notification manager:\n1val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(context) 2 .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_assistant_black_24dp) 3 .setContentTitle(getString(R.string.notification_title)) 4 .setContentText(getString(R.string.notification_description)) 5 .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_MAX) 6 .addAction(R.drawable.icon, getString(R.string.notification_button), pendingIntent) 7 8notificationManager.notify(1, builder.build()) After writing code and running the app, the notification wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting displayed. I thought maybe I was incorrectly implementing DownloadManager since I had just started playing around with it. So, after some debugging, I saw that the DownloadManager worked flawlessly and notificationBuilder did in-fact get called, but nothing was displayed ü§¶‚Äç. The next obvious step was to google the issue. The first stackOverflow answer mentioned the following change in NotificationManager for Android O and above.\nüí°So for the devices running on Android O and above, it\u0026rsquo;s required to create a channel for different kind of notifications where id, name and importance should be passed in constructor:\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { ... notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT \u0026gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) { val channel = NotificationChannel( CHANNEL_ID, getString(R.string.notification_title), NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH ) notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel) } } The same channel id should be passed in notificationBuilder\u0026rsquo;s constructor alongside with context: val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)\nMade the changes, the notification got displayed! But the action button didn\u0026rsquo;t work üòí. After another round of googling, I found out the addAction method in notificationBuilder now requires an Action class, which is basically a wrapper of the arguments addAction method used to accept.\nThe full code of sending and displaying notifications nowadays is below:\nprivate lateinit var notificationManager: NotificationManager private lateinit var action: NotificationCompat.Action override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { ... notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT \u0026gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) { val channel = NotificationChannel( CHANNEL_ID, getString(R.string.notification_title), NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH ) notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel) } val intent = Intent(this, DetailActivity::class.java) val pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 1, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT) action = NotificationCompat.Action.Builder( R.drawable.icon, getString(R.string.notification_button), pendingIntent ).build() } ... private fun downloadCompleted() { val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID) .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_assistant_black_24dp) .setContentTitle(getString(R.string.notification_title)) .setContentText(getString(R.string.notification_description)) .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_MAX) .addAction(action) notificationManager.notify(1, builder.build()) } Hopefully, this article was helpful and stay tuned for another then-and-now article!\n","date":"Mar 1, 2020","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/how-to-display-notification-in-2020/","series":null,"tags":["android"],"title":"How to Display Notifications in 2020"},{"categories":["Personal"],"content":"There is a saying in Russian ‚Äú–∫–∞–∫ –ª–æ–¥–∫—É –Ω–∞–∑–æ–≤–µ—à—å, —Ç–∞–∫ –æ–Ω–∞ –∏ –ø–æ–ø–ª—ã–≤–µ—Ç‚Äù[a boat sails in accordance with its name]. So January 1st I declared the 2019 to be more bold, tenacious and eager. And oh, has it been! 2019 was a roller-coaster of challenges and rewards.\nA few things have shaped this year:\n  Personally, I hardly ever ask people for anything I want or need. But I can definitely ask someone to do a favor to help family, friends, and colleagues. My parents taught me to put your head down, work hard, and you‚Äôll get rewarded. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not always enough. This year I‚Äôm proud of myself for stepping up and being vocal about my needs and intentions. A perfect example was asking for my promotion.\n  Another act of courage I made was when I submitted my first abstract for #AndroidSummit conference this year with what I thought was a zero chance of it being selected. But to my surprise, it was. This is a big one[‚ùó]. I haven‚Äôt done public speaking in 8 years. And haven‚Äôt done it in english for‚Ä¶ about my entire life. Thus me being a perfectionist, I made sure not to rest a day to kick it in overdrive every day for a month and a half until I wrapped up all my research into a structured paper and began religiously rehearsing the talk over and over. Then, on the day of the talk, anxiety and nervousness kicked in full speed, but somehow I managed to pull through. Two months later, I got an email my talk was selected for GDG #DevFest in Sydney, Australia. I was crazy excited. This was my first international and remote talk. But thankfully, it went through very smoothly. A week later, two of my talks were selected for #DroidconSF . I‚Äôve watched many videos about tech talks and decided to follow the tips from them. A lesson learned: do not watch any videos like these before your actual talk, it‚Äôll mess your head up.\n  My talk at #DroidconSF, which I had already given twice in the past, went terribly. I‚Äôm talking stuttering, rough transitions between my Keynote slides, and the whole first verse from Eminem‚Äôs Lose Yourself. This was my third time giving the talk, yet for some reason, it went down-hill compared to my first time. That should had not been the case. So I apologized in the middle of the talk ü§¶. Yes, it did fit a stereotype about females always saying sorry. Yes, in a professional world, you keep going as it was planned. Since then, I‚Äôve gotten many feedback that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t apologized, but it happened. However more importantly, I‚Äôve apologized to myself, because it didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. Was it right doing so, or wrong - I still don‚Äôt know.\n  My most important part of speaking this year was to recruit females in STEM. Yes, you might think what a big deal, everybody is hiring females nowadays to even the gender disbalance. But being honest and straightforward with a candidate, while still convincing them to join a company takes a lot of work. From the bright minds of the Grace Hopper program, to the interns at America\u0026rsquo;s the top universities, I‚Äôm so glad to meet each of you, and hope to see you in my team next year.\n  There is a special feeling I get every time when a female developer comes up and gives me feedback and support. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but it calms me down a lot. It is unique üíö. Hope to give and receive many more of it next year. P.S. Please remember, regardless of the gender I will always appreciate any feedback.\n  For this year I had only two goals: to speak at one conference and to write one article. I‚Äôm happy to achieve both. Years of trials and fails at new year resolutions taught me a great lesson: choosing only one goal is small. You‚Äôll just keep pushing it off to the side since you have twelve months to complete it until there aren\u0026rsquo;t any months lefts. Choosing more than two goals makes you anxious, which doesn‚Äôt help to achieve even one of them. Two is perfect - it gives just enough time to procrastinate. Yet, gives just the right amount of urgency to get yourself to reach both goals!\nAs the year [and decade] comes to an end, I‚Äôd like to thank #androidCommunity for the welcoming and continuous support, and I‚Äôm immensely grateful to be part of this amazing community!

Kotlin is well-known for null-safety and extension functions features among android developers. Extension functions provide the ability to make new functionality of an extending class without making changes to it. In addition, the new functionality can be declared outside of the extending class. They\u0026rsquo;re also very beneficial when you want to tweak an api that can\u0026rsquo;t be modified.\nWriting a good extension function comes with practice, and there are no universal rules on how or when to make them. Every developer declares the rules for themselves based on the business need of an app. But regardless of what the needs are, there are some rules I\u0026rsquo;ve set for myself.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go over some sad examples of making extensions:\nExtending android and java common types to meet business logic This reasoning comes up as a quick solution for many of us. But down the road, it\u0026rsquo;ll get dirty and unmanageable. fun CharSequence.toAnimal(): Animal { return Animal( id = this.toString(), name = this.toString(), logo = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, isDomestic = false, inRedList = false, description = this.toString() ) }\nInstead I\u0026rsquo;d recommend to separate business and common types. Extension functions are great for mapping business to business logic: fun WildAnimal.toAnimal(): Animal { return Animal( id = id, name = name, logo = logo, isDomestic = false, description = shortDescription, inRedList = inRedList ) }\nor common to common: @kotlin.internal.InlineOnly public inline fun String.toPattern(flags: Int = 0): java.util.regex.Pattern { return java.util.regex.Pattern.compile(this, flags) }\nModifying members of an extending class Extension functions are meant to extend a class with new functionality, not to modify or insert members into it.\nfun MainActivity.showWhiteLoadingIndicator() { mNumActiveLoadingIndicators++ runOnUiThread { . . . } } In the example above, extension function showWhiteLoadingIndicator() is incrementing a member of MainActivity mNumActiveLoadingIndicators.\nclass MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { var mNumActiveLoadingIndicators: Int = 0 } Although this might work and some developers do practice it, making an extension function out of it seems as an overhead to me. No one cancelled out regular member functions, which can help you achieve the same functionality in the end.\nclass MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { var mNumActiveLoadingIndicators: Int = 0 fun showWhiteLoadingIndicator() { mNumActiveLoadingIndicators++ runOnUiThread { . . . } } Using the same name as a member function This is not a sad example, more of a caution to developers, who are switching to Kotlin and trying out extension functions. When making an extension function, be careful with naming. If it matches a member function, and is applicable to given arguments, compiler will choose the member function over an extension function.\n@RemotableViewMethod public void setBackgroundColor(@ColorInt int color) { if (mBackground instanceof ColorDrawable) { ((ColorDrawable) mBackground.mutate()).setColor(color); computeOpaqueFlags(); mBackgroundResource = 0; } else { setBackground(new ColorDrawable(color)); } } setBackgroundColor(@ColorInt int color) is a member function of View class in android, and it accepts argument of type int. Now if we look at the below extension function, the name and argument type match the member function.\nfun View.setBackgroundColor(colorResId: Int) { setBackgroundColor( ContextCompat.getColor( context, colorResId ) ) } Instead, the easiest solution will be to rename the extension function:\nfun View.setBackgroundColorResId(colorId: Int) { setBackgroundColor( ContextCompat.getColor( context, colorId ) ) } Extending context on every occasion We have all heard that the best way to start converting your app to kotlin is by converting util or helper methods into extension functions. Most likely, those methods at some point require the context to be passed: public static void showGif(String url, Context context, ImageView imageView) { Glide.with(context).asGif() .listener(new RequestListener\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt;() { @Override public boolean onLoadFailed(@Nullable GlideException e, Object model, Target\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt; target, boolean isFirstResource) { return false; } @Override public boolean onResourceReady(GifDrawable resource, Object model, Target\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt; target, DataSource dataSource, boolean isFirstResource) { return false; } }) .load(url) .into(imageView); }\nAnd naturally, the first thought is to extend the context where the rest of parameters can be passed to it: fun Context.showGif(imageView: ImageView, url: String) { Glide.with(this) .asGif() .listener(object : RequestListener\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt; { override fun onLoadFailed(e: GlideException?, model: Any?, target: Target\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt;?,isFirstResource: Boolean ) = false override fun onResourceReady(resource: GifDrawable?, model: Any?, target: Target\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt;?, dataSource: DataSource?, isFirstResource: Boolean ) = false }) .load(url) .into(imageView) }\nAt first glance, compiler doesn‚Äôt give any errors, the code runs, and the same functionality is preserved. But if we look at the docs, we can see that the ImageView class already has a member function, that returns a type Context. Therefore we can retrieve context directly from it by extending Imageview: fun ImageView.asGif(url: String) { Glide.with(this.context) .asGif() .listener(object : RequestListener\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt; { override fun onLoadFailed(e: GlideException?, model: Any?, target: Target\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt;?, isFirstResource: Boolean ) = false override fun onResourceReady(resource: GifDrawable?, model: Any?, target: Target\u0026lt;GifDrawable\u0026gt;?, dataSource: DataSource?, isFirstResource: Boolean ) = false }) .load(url) .into(this) }\nAnother case I commonly see is to extend context to display some other views: fun Context.showDialog(message: String, activity: Activity?) { if (activity != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !activity.isFinishing) { MaterialDialog.Builder(this) .content(message) .positiveText(\u0026#34;Ok\u0026#34;) .show() } }\nBe aware, that by extending Context, you\u0026rsquo;re letting every other context subclass that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have access to Window class have the ability to call the extension function. For instance, you can access context inside service, therefore you can call context.showDialog(), but dialog needs to be drawn on window, that needs an access to content which lives on activity, therefore calling showDialog() in service will crash.\nNow about some good practices:\nMaking an extension function out of a nullable receiver public actual fun String?.equals(other: String?, ignoreCase: Boolean = false): Boolean { if (this === null) return other === null return if (!ignoreCase) (this as java.lang.String).equals(other) else (this as java.lang.String).equalsIgnoreCase(other) } Adding iterators via extension functions This is a perfect example of extending a limited api: inline fun Menu.forEach(action: (item: MenuItem) -\u0026gt; Unit) { for (index in 0 until size()) { action(getItem(index)) } }\nConverting from one interface to another public fun \u0026lt;K, V\u0026gt; Map\u0026lt;out K, V\u0026gt;.asSequence(): Sequence\u0026lt;Map.Entry\u0026lt;K, V\u0026gt;\u0026gt; { return entries.asSequence() } It\u0026rsquo;s important to structure extension functions properly. For example, I usually create a file that contains all extension functions of a receiver type. It\u0026rsquo;s easy down the road for new developers in the team to not make duplicated functions, and also easy to copy a file from one project to another üòÑ .\nCode samples can be found here Huge thanks to Eugenio Lopez for being so patient and reviewing the article many times üôè\n","date":"Dec 29, 2019","permalink":"https://cupsofcode.com/post/good-and-sad-extensions/","series":null,"tags":["android","kotlin"],"title":"Good and Sad Examples of Extension Functions"},{"categories":null,"content":"The list of the talks I\u0026rsquo;ve given in the past.

The startup later was acquired by Goldman Sachs, where I built their banking app, Marcus, until March of 2021. Then I moved on to Doordash, where I worked on Pickup tab. And in January of 2022 I joined Twitter.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s my journey in a nutshell.\nBlogging I like to share tidbits of knowledge I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered throughout the years. Some of them may be very specific to Android development, some of them are about general software development, and some are about soft skills that are helpful in a career.\nAs you guessed most of my articles are published on this blog. Sometimes when I feel courageous enough, I give talks . And sometimes when I need to vent out, I post witty and sarcastic short videos about tech life on Tiktok .\nPortfolio Courses I\u0026rsquo;ve also collaborated with Udacity and curated Advanced Android Apps with Kotlin, Part 1 of Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree .\nClick here to learn more about choosing best courses for mobile app development.\nApps Here is the list of apps I built, worked and released:\n1.
