With Bootstrap theme as my ideal choice, I decided to nosedive into migrating over until I was faced with my first blocker&amp;hellip; upgrading Hugo to its latest version.
My current Hugo version: 0.61.0
The new theme’s minimum required version: 0.75.0
What could be so interesting about upgrading Hugo that I decided to write a blog post about it?</description></item><item><title>How to create your custom Link in Bio landing page in Hugo under 10 mins</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how_to_build_custom_link_in_bio_landing_social_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how_to_build_custom_link_in_bio_landing_social_page/</guid><description>Link in Bio landing pages became very popular since Instagram limited only single URL per profile info.

Disposables are streams/links/connections between Observer and Observable. They&amp;rsquo;re meant to give power to the Observers to control Observables. In most cases, the Observer is a UI element, ie; Fragment, Activity, or a corresponding viewmodel of those elements.

For example, I was working on my side-project which sends a notification once the download is completed (was checking how DownloadManager works).
Back in 2016, you&amp;rsquo;d need to initialize NotificationManager and pending intent if notification contains custom action:

Kotlin is well-known for null-safety and extension functions features among android developers. Extension functions provide the ability to make new functionality of an extending class without making changes to it. In addition, the new functionality can be declared outside of the extending class. They&amp;rsquo;re also very beneficial when you want to tweak an api that can&amp;rsquo;t be modified.</description></item><item><title>Talks</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/talks/</guid><description>The list of the talks I&amp;rsquo;ve given in the past.
