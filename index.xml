With Bootstrap theme as my ideal choice, I decided to nosedive into migrating over until I was faced with my first blocker&amp;hellip; upgrading Hugo to its latest version.
My current Hugo version: 0.61.0
The new theme’s minimum required version: 0.75.0
What could be so interesting about upgrading Hugo that I decided to write a blog post about it?</description></item><item><title>How to create your custom Link in Bio landing page in Hugo under 10 mins</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how_to_build_custom_link_in_bio_landing_social_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/post/how_to_build_custom_link_in_bio_landing_social_page/</guid><description>Link in Bio landing pages became very popular since Instagram limited only single URL per profile info.

Table Of Contents: Disposable CompositeDisposable SerialDisposable Conclusion Disposable RxJava 2 introduced the concept of Disposables .
Disposables are streams/links/connections between Observer and Observable. They&amp;rsquo;re meant to give power to the Observers to control Observables. In most cases, the Observer is a UI element, ie; Fragment, Activity, or a corresponding viewmodel of those elements. While Observable represents a data flow where data can be passed from one source to another and get modified along the way if needed.</description></item><item><title>How to choose mobile app development course online?</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/courses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/courses/</guid><description>There are so many different courses, tutorials, and instructions out there for you to learn mobile development. In the sea of options, it’s important to understand what will help you be ready in the professional workplace and excel in programming.
While there are some teachers that can explain the concept well, you may leave the class asking yourself how can you apply this knowledge.

For example, I was working on my side-project which sends a notification once the download is completed (was checking how DownloadManager works).
Back in 2016, you&amp;rsquo;d need to initialize NotificationManager and pending intent if notification contains custom action:

Kotlin is well-known for null-safety and extension functions features among android developers. Extension functions provide the ability to make new functionality of an extending class without making changes to it. In addition, the new functionality can be declared outside of the extending class. They&amp;rsquo;re also very beneficial when you want to tweak an api that can&amp;rsquo;t be modified.</description></item><item><title>Talks</title><link>https://cupsofcode.com/talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupsofcode.com/talks/</guid><description>The list of the talks I&amp;rsquo;ve given in the past.
